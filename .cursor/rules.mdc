Add new O RLY book cover + entries

When asked to add a new book given an image filename (e.g., mind-reading.jpeg):

- Move image

  - Source: public/toadd/<filename>
  - Destination: public/book_covers/<filename>
  - Do not overwrite existing files.

- Derive identifiers and metadata from the cover

  - slug/id = filename without extension (kebab-case as-is).
  - title = the big red-rectangle title text on the cover. If not readable,
    use start-case of slug or a title provided by the user.
  - headlines = the smaller italic sentence(s) above/below the rectangle.
    If there are two, combine with " | " (space, pipe, space) into one string.
  - author text on the image is NOT stored anywhere; ignore it.

- Update src/server/storage/books.ts

  - Append a new object to BOOK_LIBRARY with:

    - id: <slug>
    - title: <title>
    - image: <filename>
    - headline: the combined headline(s) as above; if none, use a short
      placeholder to be edited later.
    - color: use the color of the red rectangle on the cover mapped to
      ColorPalette. Accept only values in ColorPalette. Default to "blue" if
      unclear.
    - tags: short comma-separated list; default to "development" if not provided.
    - createdAt: current UTC ISO string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.000Z).

  - Important specifics to avoid searching in the future:
    - Color options are defined by `ColorPalette` in the same file and must be
      one of: gray, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, teal, cyan, sky, blue,
      indigo, violet, fuchsia, pink.
    - Always append new items at the END of `BOOK_LIBRARY`.

- Update src/server/storage/stories.ts

  - Append: { id: "<slug>", content: "" } (empty content for the user to fill in).

- Update public/sitemap.xml

  - Append a <url> entry:
    - <loc>https://orlybooks.com/books/<slug></loc>
    - <lastmod> same createdAt date (UTC, no milliseconds, suffixed with Z)
      e.g., 2025-08-30T12:00:00Z
    - <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    - <priority>1.0</priority>

- Conventions

  - Do not change existing indentation or formatting in edited files.
  - Keep array/item ordering stable; add new items at the end of arrays.
  - Run linter checks on edited files and fix obvious issues.
  - The image hosting path used by the app is `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_SOURCE`;
    just moving the file to `public/book_covers/` is enough for local dev.

- Confirmation to user
  - Summarize: image moved, book added, empty story added, sitemap updated. Ask for story content if they want it filled in now.
