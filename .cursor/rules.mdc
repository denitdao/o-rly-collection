Add new O RLY book cover + entries

When asked to add a new book given an image filename (e.g., mind-reading.jpeg):

- Move image

  - Source: public/toadd/<filename>
  - Destination: public/book_covers/<filename>
  - Do not overwrite existing files.

- Derive identifiers

  - slug/id = filename without extension (kebab-case as-is).
  - title = human title (start-case of slug, or provided by user).

- Update src/server/storage/books.ts

  - Append a new object to BOOK_LIBRARY with:
    - id: <slug>
    - title: <title>
    - image: <filename>
    - headline: use the caption provided by the user; if not provided, use text from the cover or a short placeholder to be edited later.
    - color: pick from ColorPalette; default to "blue" if not specified.
    - tags: short comma-separated list; default to "development" if not provided.
    - createdAt: current UTC ISO string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.000Z).

- Update src/server/storage/stories.ts

  - Append: { id: "<slug>", content: "" } (empty content for the user to fill in).

- Update public/sitemap.xml

  - Append a <url> entry:
    - <loc>https://orlybooks.com/books/<slug></loc>
    - <lastmod> same createdAt date (UTC, no milliseconds, suffixed with Z)</lastmod>
    - <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    - <priority>1.0</priority>

- Conventions

  - Do not change existing indentation or formatting in edited files.
  - Keep array/item ordering stable; add new items at the end of arrays.
  - Run linter checks on edited files and fix obvious issues.

- Confirmation to user
  - Summarize: image moved, book added, empty story added, sitemap updated. Ask for story content if they want it filled in now.
